# this library can be used to control 2 servo motors and 2 distance sensors + 3 light sensors
# it is developed for small sumorobots, in the project you can also find the schematics for the arduino extensionboard

1) copy sumolib into your arduino libraries folder
2) restart arduino and press Sketch > Import Library... > sumolib
3) write some code xD (also the example "Drive" is available)

cd /var/tmp
git clone http://github.com/silps/sumoino.git
cp -R Sumorobot /usr/share/arduino/libraries
