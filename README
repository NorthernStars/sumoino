# this library can be used to control 2 servo motors and 2 distance + 3 light sensors
# in the project you can also find the schematics for the arduino extensionboard

1) copy sumolib into your arduino libraries folder
2) restart arduino and press Sketch > Import Library... > Sumorobot
3) write some code xD (also the examples "Drive", "Avoid", "Opponent" are available)

cd /var/tmp
git clone http://github.com/silps/sumoino.git
cp -R Sumorobot /usr/share/arduino/libraries
